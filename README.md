Statistics Workshop in R for CHEM4150
The https://chrismgentry.github.io/chemstats/ website contains scripts to help students in CHEM 4150 Data Analysis understand how to use R for analysis of their data.
Examples include:
* Reading data from excel files,
* Light formatting of data,
* Measures of central tendency,
* ttest, anova, and regression, and
* Plotting with ggplot2

The ChemData.xlsx file is a compilation of sample data used for this example.
