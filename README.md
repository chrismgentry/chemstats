Statistics Workshop in R for CHEM4150
The CHEM4150_Script.txt file contains a script to help students in CHEM 4150 Data Analysis understand how to use R for analysis of their data.
Examples include:
* Reading data from excel files or a website,
* Light formatting of data,
* measures of central tendency,
* ttest, anova, correlation, and regression, and
* plotting with ggplot2

The ChemData.xlsx file is a compilation of sample data used for this example.
